## üìñ Current Resources

While we prepare this deployment guide, explore these resources:

- **[CLI Reference](../api/cli)** - Command-line tools for development and building
- **[Your First App](../tutorial-basics/your-first-app)** - Basic app development workflow
- **[Multiple Windows](../tutorial-basics/multiple-windows)** - Advanced application patterns

## üí° Quick Preview

Here's a preview of what building OneForAll apps will look like:

```bash
# Development mode
oneforall dev my_app.py

# Build for current platform
oneforall build my_app.py

# Build with custom options
oneforall build my_app.py --name "My App" --icon app_icon.ico

# Cross-platform build
oneforall build my_app.py --target windows --target macos --target linux
```

### Basic Build Configuration

```json
// .oneforall.json
{
  "build": {
    "name": "My OneForAll App",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "icon": "assets/icon.ico",
    "exclude": ["tests/", "docs/"],
    "include_data": ["assets/", "config/"],
    "console": false,
    "single_file": true
  },
  "deploy": {
    "auto_update": true,
    "update_server": "https://updates.myapp.com",
    "code_signing": {
      "certificate": "path/to/cert.p12",
      "password_env": "CERT_PASSWORD"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Deployment Strategies

### Desktop Applications
- **Single Executable** - Everything bundled in one file
- **Directory Distribution** - App with supporting files
